# Sentiment-Analysis
Classifying Customer reviews into Positive and Negative Sentiment

Sentiment analysis and classification is a computational study which attempts to address this problem by extracting subjective information from the given texts
in natural language, such as opinions and sentiments. Diâ†µerent approaches have used to tackle this problem from natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics. In recent years, Machine learning methods have got popular in the semantic and review analysis for their simplicity and accuracy

Amazon is one of the e-commerce giants that people are using every day for online purchases where they can read thousands of reviews dropped by other
customers about their desired products. These reviews provide valuable opinions about a product such as its property, quality and recommendations whichhelps the purchasers to understand almost every detail of a product. This is not only beneficial for consumers but also helps sellers who are manufacturing their own products to understand the consumers and their needs better.

This project is considering the sentiment classification problem for online reviews using supervised approaches to determine the overall semantic of customer reviews by classifying them into positive and negative sentiment.
